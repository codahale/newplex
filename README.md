# Newplex

Newplex provides an incremental, stateful cryptographic primitive for symmetric-key cryptographic operations (e.g.,
hashing, encryption, message authentication codes, and authenticated encryption) in complex protocols. Inspired
by [TupleHash], [STROBE], [Noise Protocol]'s stateful objects, [Merlin] transcripts, [SpongeWrap], and [Xoodyak]'s
Cyclist mode, Newplex uses the [Simpira-1024] permutation to provide 10+ Gb/second performance on modern processors at a
128-bit security level.

## ⚠️ Security Warning

**This code has not been audited. This design has not been analyzed.** The design is documented in [
`design.md`](design.md); read it and see if the arguments therein are convincing. It is experimental and should not be
used for production systems or critical security applications.
Use at your own risk.

## Installation

```bash
go get github.com/codahale/newplex
```

## Usage

On AMD64 and ARM64 architectures, newplex uses the AES-NI instruction set to achieve this level of performance. On other
architectures, or if the `purego` build tag is used, it uses a much-slower Go implementation with a bitsliced,
constant-time AES round implementation.

### Protocol

`Protocol` is a high-level API, designed for easily building complex cryptographic constructions (e.g., hash functions,
MACs, stream ciphers, AEADs, sessions) with domain separation and state management.

```go
// Initialize a protocol with a domain separation string.
p := newplex.NewProtocol("my-app.my-protocol")

// Mix key material and other data into the state.
p.Mix("key", []byte("secret-key-material"))
p.Mix("nonce", []byte("unique-nonce"))

// Encrypt a message (provides confidentiality).
plaintext := []byte("Hello, World!")
ciphertext := p.Encrypt("message", nil, plaintext)

// Or Seal a message (provides confidentiality + authenticity).
sealed := p.Seal("secure-message", nil, plaintext)

// Derive pseudorandom output (like a KDF or Hash).
tag := p.Derive("tag", nil, 32)
```
